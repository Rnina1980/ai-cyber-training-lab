🧠 AI-Cyber Training Lab

Hands-on cybersecurity investigation and detection lab using Sysmon telemetry, Python automation, and machine-learning-based threat classification.

This project is part of my ongoing professional development as a Cybersecurity Analyst preparing for roles involving AI-driven security, threat hunting, automation, and SOC engineering.
It includes:

Sysmon log collection & parsing

JSON normalization using Pandas

Python-based detection logic

ML classification of suspicious activity

Experimentation with adversarial behavior detection

Real-world log analysis from a virtualized lab environment

This repository will grow as I continue training and expanding skills in:
CrowdStrike, Qualys, Splunk/SOAR, Python security automations, and AI-assisted cyber defense tooling.
